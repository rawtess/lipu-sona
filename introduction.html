      <p>hi! welcome to my toki pona course!</p>
      <p>
        i first made this course to teach my girlfriend toki pona, because i
        disagree with other courses on many small and big things and i didn't
        want to have to correct the courses while fae was going through them.
      </p>
      <p>
        however, i put a lot of work into this course, so i figured i may as
        well also put it out online for anyone else to use!
      </p>

    <div class="box">
      <p>
        i tried my best to do a good compromise between my personal style and
        the style of pu, and i think it should be a good starting point for
        anyone interested in learning toki pona. ultimately, it's up to you to
        form your own style after you're done with this course.

      <p>
        this course will not make you fluent. no course out there will! toki
        pona may be minimalist, but it's still a complex language to learn.
        people spend several years before they even start considering themselves
        fluent, and you will probably be no different.
      </p>
      <p>
        however, this course will give you a good understanding of all the
        important fundamentals of toki pona, so you can then go on to explore
        the language on your own!
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="box box-top">
      <p>
        i think that using the language actively is very important while
        learning, and i highly recommend joining toki pona communities where you
        can practice speaking the language and ask questions.
