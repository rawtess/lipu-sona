        i'm a worker. my place of work is a restaurant. a lot of people call me
        a chef.
      </p>
      <p>
        i make a lot of food. people eat it. they say bad things about the food
      </p>
      <p>
        the restaurant doesn't let me work well. they want a lot of work, not
        good work.
      </p>
      <p>i want people to know how good i am! i can make good food!</p>
      <p>
        some people see me. they say "you're staring at me. i want you to go
        away!"
      </p>
      <p>
        i go away. the people make me feel bad. i don't want to be a chef. i
        don't want to make food. people don't know how good i am
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="box box-top">
      <p>
        i look at a colourful room. i look at the colourful room a lot. it's
        nice looking.
      </p>
      <p>a person speaks. "this room really makes you better!"</p>
      <p>
        "it makes me feel better. people say bad things about mi. this room
        doesn't."
      </p>
      <p>
        "these bad people are small. what they have to say is small. i
        knowledgeable say that you're good."
      </p>
      <p>"you don't know that! you don't know me!"</p>
      <p>
        "i don't know you. i know your work. i eat your food a lot. it fixes me.
        a lot of people want a lot of work from me. your food strengthens me.
        this strength makes me able to do the work these people desire."
      </p>
      <p>"what you said made me feel a lot better!!"</p>
      <p>
        what the person said filled me with confidence. i was reminded that i
        can make good food!
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="box">

        food. i know how to be confident. i work confidently. they know my
        strength. they know my goodness.
